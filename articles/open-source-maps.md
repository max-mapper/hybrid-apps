## Open Source Maps In HTML5 Apps

- in gather for map data/tiles I use mapbox.com which is a node.js powered map design + hosting company that uses data from a combination of Natural Earth and OSM
- the app uses the mapbox.com static maps API as well as the Leaflet.js project for interactive slippy maps
