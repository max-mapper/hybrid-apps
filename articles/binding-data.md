## Binding Data To UI In A Modular Way (Without Frameworks)
or
## Event Based Programming For Modular HTML5 Apps

these titles are a bit vague. I want this article to be about how to apply the node.js "small module" pattern to client side apps. need to think more about the scope of the article + the title. it also might overlap with the client side routing/templating article.

other topics relevant to this article: 

- minimizing the number of bound events for performance reasons: using zeptos .on (formerly .live)
- using data- attrs
- the art of simple templates
- is MVC a relevant metaphor for client side stuff
