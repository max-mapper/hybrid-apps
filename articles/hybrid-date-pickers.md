## Date Pickers: Should You Go Native Or HTML5?

- phonegap plugins for date picking: are they worth it? answer is probably no since mobiscroll is pretty good
- html5 doesnt have a cross platform date picking UI
- there is a js lib called mobiscroll that I use for the gather web app date pickers


from a previous article:
<p>
  iOS has a combination date + time picker in a single dialog but Android offers only date or time but not both, so we have to add a new input field for Android users and branch a few times in the code to handle both platforms correctly.
